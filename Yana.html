            <p> At 21 years old, I've already seen a bit of the world. I grew up in Birmingham but decided to take the leap and move to Norway not too long ago.<br> I've been working as a chef assistant, but I've come to realize that it's not the right fit for me. So, I've been exploring various career paths over the past year.  <br> I'm looking for something that truly excites me and makes me feel fulfilled. Recently, I stumbled upon a tweet that sparked my interest in coding. After countless hours of research, I found Pivot2Tech, a software engineering course, which I'm super excited to take. <br> As someone who's been exploring different career paths, I'm hopeful that this path will lead me to a fulfilling job in the future. I can't wait to see what's next in store for me on this journey.
